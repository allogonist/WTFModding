There are 3 folders here:

brushes
prefabs
Content

When you build the project for the first time it will complain about missing content. It should generate a directory that looks like this:

"C:\<directory of your MTF Modding Repo>\PrefabEditor\PrefabEditor\bin\Windows\Debug\"

navigate to that directory and copy the above folders into it so you have:

"C:\<directory of your MTF Modding Repo>\PrefabEditor\PrefabEditor\bin\Windows\Debug\brushes\"
"C:\<directory of your MTF Modding Repo>\PrefabEditor\PrefabEditor\bin\Windows\Debug\prefabs\"
"C:\<directory of your MTF Modding Repo>\PrefabEditor\PrefabEditor\bin\Windows\Debug\Content\"

now your PrefabEditor.exe should run and the first thing you will see is a file prompt. Select an example prefab to see its contents, or click cancel to create a new prefab from scratch.

I don't want to hear about how horrible this code is, it is like 6 years old you are lucky it runs at all. Please feel free to rewrite it to suck less.
